## Services 
I have always strived to be involved in various synergistic activities to share my knowledge and give back to the community. Specifically, I am a permanent member of [Ikala STEM, Chapter America](https://www.ikalastem.org/), an organization dedicated to empowering the next generation of Malagasy women in STEM. While in Hungary, I also served as a mentor at [Stipendium Hungaricum Mentorship program](https://shmentor.hu/), where I assisted ten international students in getting used to the Hungarian education system. Back in Madagascar, I was a volunteer and an active member of the [Malagasy Youth Biodiversity Network](https://gybninfo.wordpress.com/national-chapters/malagasy-youth-biodiversity-network/), an organization dedicated to achieve sustainable development goals by increasing awareness on the importance of biodiversity and the consequences of biodiversity loss. I also served as a Leader at [Teach for Madagascar](https://teach4madagascar.org/), where I taught literacy skills to illiterate children and English to primary school students.
