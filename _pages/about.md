I am Ny Aina, pronounced as [Nee-Aena]. I am a Ph.D. candidate working with [Dr. Hamed Gholizadeh](https://hamedgholizadeh.wixsite.com/mysite) in the Department of Geography at Oklahoma State University. My research focuses on using remote sensing coupled with *in situ* observations and modeling to address ecological questions. I am particularly interested in assessing the capability of imaging spectroscopy in answering ecological questions, such as biological invasions. My current research focuses on using imaging spectroscopy to detect invasive plants and assess their impacts on aboveground and belowground ecosystem characteristics in grassland ecosystems. I am always open to collaborations, discussions, or simply connecting, so please feel free to contact me at ny_aina.rakotoarivony@okstate.edu.

### Some extra facts
I am from Madagascar, the fourth largest island on Earth. It is lying off the southeastern coast of Africa. You might have heard about it from the "Madagascar movie." And no, we do not have lions nor penguins in Madagascar, but we do have high level of endemic flora and fauna. Among them, we have several lemur species, including "King Julien," scientifically known as *lemur catta* and the famous "Upside-down tree", commonly known as the Baobab Tree.
